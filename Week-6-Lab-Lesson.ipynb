    "\n",
    "A **version control system**, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together.

    "# Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. GitHub makes it easy to add a README and other files, such as licenses and codes of conduct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open up a console in JupyterHub and load it up side-by-side with this notebook. Then, open a second tab in your browser, and go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a new repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On GitHub, in the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click + and then select **New repository**.\n",
    "2. Name your repository **hello-world**.\n",
    "3. Write a short description.\n",
    "4. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.\n",
    "5. Click **Create repository**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting it from GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `git clone` will make an exact copy, including all changes, of any repository you give it. When using GitHub, your command will be `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git`. This is something you've done before.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go to your repository page, click the green **Clone or Download** button near the top right corner, and click the copy to clipboard button (the clipboard icon), you can paste the path directly into your terminal. \n",

    "# Commitment issues\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this is a pretty boring repository. Let's add to it. Use `vim` to create a new text file. Type whatever you want in it, just a few sentences. Once you're done, save your file, and `ls` to make sure it's there. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Diversion: what actually *is* a repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you know how you can use `ls` with the `-a` flag to print *all* the files, even the hidden ones? Let's do that here; it'll reveal something cool. If you do `ls -a`, you'll see two files you didn't know were there: `.git` and `.gitignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.gitignore` is a file where you can specify files for `git` to, well, ignore. Things like sensitive passwords or databases, you don't want to put up on GitHub for everyone to see, so this lets you quickly tell `git` to not save anything you don't want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.git` is much deeper, though: it's where the repository actually lives. `.git` is actually a *directory* which contains information about the repository and a list of every change you've ever made in the repository. Every time you tell `git` to save your work, it'll track everything you've altered, removed, or added to the repository in that `.git` folder. That way, if you ever want to revert back to a previous change, you can do so. And, additionally, anyone who can see your repository can look at how your code has changed and developed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving your work\n",
    "\n",
    "You tell `git` to save your work by using the command `git commit`. Committing is *like* hitting \"Save\" on a Word document, but it's a little more intentional than that; because you have to specifically tell `git` why you're saving, a **commit** is a human-meaningful amount of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, go ahead and run `git commit -m \"my first commit\"`. The `-m` flag stands for **message**, and that's how you tell `git` and, by extension, anyone who looks at your repository, what you did for this commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## `git` is stubborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember what `git`'s description is? If you add files or folders to a repository and you want to commit them, you have to explicitly tell `git` to include. You do that with the command `git add`. To add everything in a repository, you'd use the `.` which, as you remember, stands for \"the current directory\". So, go ahead and run `git add .` and then try committing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is your first real commit, write your own message! Describe, in a few words, what you did. (Make sure you wrap your message in quotes.) "

Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
