## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Version control! :tada:

If you didn't make a GitHub account already, do that super quick right now _because_:

This week we will be applying some of our command-line knowledge to learn how to use `git`! The format for today is the same as last week: follow along with me in your lecture notebook. Then, at the end, I'll explain your group project assignment!

## Getting Started™

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab to
3. Type in git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/lab-5.git and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called lab-5)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Submitting your finished lab

This lab is due at 11:59 PM the Friday after your next lab session. You'll be submitting your GitHub repo!

To submit: copy the URL of your repo and submit it to Canvas. Each group member needs to do this.
